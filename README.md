# Solana Volume Bot

## Overview
Solana Volume Bot is a Telegram bot that allows users to increate the trade volume in both Meteora and Raydium Pools. It also provides functionalities like starting and pausing a volume boost bot, setting target volumes, and handling deposits/withdrawals of SOL. 

The bot integrates with the Solana blockchain to track wallet balances, handle token transfers, and execute volume-boosting operations based on token data from supported DEX platforms.

## Features
- **Start/Stop Bot**: Start or pause the bot’s operations to boost token volume.
- **Token Information**: Fetches token details, such as price, market cap, volume, and more.
- **Volume Tracking**: Displays the volume generated by the bot and lets you set a target.
- **Deposit Address**: Provides users with a SOL wallet address to receive deposits.
- **Withdrawal**: Allows users to withdraw SOL to an external address.
- **User Wallet Management**: Automatically generates and stores a wallet for users.

2. **Install dependencies**:
